A box $b^y$ is the upper \textit{boundary} of box $b^x$ along dimension $r$ if and only if $u^x_r = (y_r - x_r)$. A box $b^y$ is the lower \textit{boundary} of box $b^x$ along dimension $r$ if and only if $l^x_r = (x_r - y_r)$.



\begin{theorem}
  A Voronoi mesh composed of $n$ unique control points in $d$ dimensions, $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, is space filling.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Consider interpolating at point $z$. Let $c^{(1)}$ be the $c \in C$ that minimizes $||z-c||_2$. Now, $z$ must be in the support of the basis function $v^{c^{(1)}}$. Therefore the Voronoi mesh is space filling.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
A \textit{mutual} boundary between boxes $b^x$ and $b^y$ is when there exists an $r$ such that $u^x_r = l^y_r$ or $l^x_r = u^y_r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} An iterative box mesh composed of $n$ unique control points in $d$ dimensions, $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, is space filling. \end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The first box added to an $IBM$ is space filling by construction. Assume that an $IBM$ composed of $n$ boxes is space filling and a new box anchored at $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is added. Consider a point $y \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Every box $b^{x^{(i)}}$ that had $y$ on its interior before the addition of $b^x$ and was reshaped along dimension $r \in [1,d]$ has a mutual boundary with $b^x$ by construction. Now either $\bigl| x_r - x^{(i)}_r \bigr| \geq \bigl| y_r - x^{(i)}_r \bigr|$ and $y$ is still on the interior of $b^{x^{(i)}}$, or $\bigl| x_r - x^{(i)}_r \bigr| < \bigl| y_r - x^{(i)}_r \bigr|$ and $y$ is on the interior of $b^x$. Therefore, the $IBM$ composed of $n+1$ boxes is still space filling.
\end{proof}




\begin{definition}
A box $b^y$ is the upper \textit{boundary} of box $b^x$ along dimension $r$ if and only if $u^x_r = (y_r - x_r)$. A box $b^y$ is the lower \textit{boundary} of box $b^x$ along dimension $r$ if and only if $l^x_r = (x_r - y_r)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
A max box mesh composed of $n$ unique control points in $d$ dimensions, $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ whose bounding box is $(L,U)$, $L,U \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a covering for $(L,U)$ when there are no cycles in box boundaries.
\label{theorem_mutual_space_filling}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Pick an arbitrary point $L < x < U$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Now let $c^{(1)}$ be the $c \in C$ that minimizes $\|c - x\|_\infty$, making the nearest box (by max norm) $b^{c^{(1)}}$. Either $x$ is on the interior of $b^{c^{(1)}}$ or on the boundary of $b^{c^{(1)}}$ and this is done, or $b^{c^{(1)}}$ has a boundary along dimension $r$ with box $b^{c^{(2)}}$ such that $|c^{(2)}_r - x_r| < |c^{(1)}_r - x_r|$. If the sequence of boundaries $c^{(2)}$, $\ldots$ has no cycles there must be a last box in the sequence that contains $x$. Therefore, when there are no cycles in box boundaries, the $MBM$ is a covering of $(L,U)$.
\end{proof}


The max box mesh as proposed is still capable of producing coefficients of 0 for $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ placed along the boundary of boxes, however this problem is solved by increasing the upper and lower widths of all boxes by the unit roundoff during computation. For this reason, t

\begin{definition}
A box $b^y$ is the upper \textit{boundary} of box $b^x$ along dimension $r$ if and only if $u^x_r = (y_r - x_r)$. A box $b^y$ is the lower \textit{boundary} of box $b^x$ along dimension $r$ if and only if $l^x_r = (x_r - y_r)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \textit{proper} upper boundary for box $b^x$ at point $y$ occurs when $u^x_r = ||x - y||_\infty$ and $r$ is the first dimension such that $u^x_r = ||x - y||_\infty$, assuming dimensions are deterministically ordered. The same definition applies to lower boundaries.
\end{definition}
