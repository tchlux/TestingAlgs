Finishing a Ph.D. is hard work. It's not always fun. And sometimes it's stressful. But the people I've met along the way, the things I've learned, and the people from all paths of life that have supported me throughout this journey made all the difference. My gratitudes are endless, but I'll do my best to enumerate some here.
{\vspace{2mm} \\}
First and foremost I want to thank my advisor Dr. Watson for his enduring push for deep scientific rigor and always reminding me of my most important job, to ``think!'' While reading that without context might fall short, Dr. Watson's incredible effort, earnest care, and impressive repertoire of knowledge afforded me many great lessons throughout my graduate tenure that I value dearly. His genuine feedback has helped me become a better researcher and he's someone I won't hesitate to consult in the future.
{\vspace{2mm} \\}
I want to thank my coadvisor Dr. Hong for deepening my knowledge of statistics and introducing me to countless relevant and interesting lines of research. His support and direction drove the statistical significance of my work. In addition I want to thank all of my committee members for their care and contributions, Dr. Cameron for asking important practical questions and encouraging a bigger picture cohesion throughout my work, Dr. Huang and Dr. Wang for ensuring theoretical groundedness and relevance to modern research as well as being great teachers, and Dr. Cao for motivating many connections between my work and other areas of applied computational science.
{\vspace{-1mm} \\}
I was uniquely lucky in that the entirety of my work at Virginia Tech was supported by the VarSys project. Those team members, both students and faculty, guided my growth as a researcher and my research direction as a whole. I thank them all for the many conversations about fascinating and diverse topics in computer science, as well as constant feedback and collaboration that broadened my interests and drove me to produce higher quality results.
{\vspace{2mm} \\}
Where would I be without my closest friends through graduate school. I sincerely thank all of Grad Council, those who helped found the group and see it to its great success as a leading computer science graduate council in the nation. I am especially grateful for my lab mates Tyler Chang and Ayaan Kazerouni for the lunches around Blacksburg, encouraging conversations, and general support that made graduate life fun and memorable in ways that it would never have been otherwise.
{\vspace{2mm} \\}
Another thanks goes to my family for their continued love and support, particularly my parents Karen and John Lux, brothers Dylan and Austen, sisters Amy, and Arial, and grandmothers Gooma and Mor Mor. They have made all the difference and I am unbelievably grateful for them all.
{\vspace{2mm} \\}
Lastly I would like to thank my fianc\'e Alex Grant for her enduring love and support over the last four years. I couldn't imagine getting this far without our fun trips to Kentucky, summers together, and Skype dinner and movie dates that made the distance between us from Blacksburg to St. Louis bearable.

\abstract{Function approximation is an important problem. This work presents applications of interpolants to modeling random variables. Specifically, this work studies the prediction of distributions of random variables applied to computer system throughput variability. Existing approximation methods including multivariate adaptive regression splines, support vector regressors, multilayer perceptrons, Shepard variants, and the Delaunay mesh are investigated in the context of computer variability modeling. New methods of approximation using Box splines, Voronoi cells, and Delaunay for interpolating distributions of data with moderately high dimension are presented and compared with existing approaches. Novel theoretical error bounds are constructed for piecewise linear interpolants over functions with a Lipschitz continuous gradient. Finally, a mathematical software that constructs monotone quintic spline interpolants for distribution approximation from data samples is proposed.}

% The general audience abstract is required. There are currently no word limits.
\abstractgenaud{It is common for scientists to collect data on something they are studying. Often scientists want to create a (predictive) model of that phenomenon based on the data, but the choice of \textit{how} to model the data is a difficult one to answer. This work proposes methods for modeling data that operate under very few assumptions that are broadly applicable across science. Finally, a software package is proposed that would allow scientists to better understand the \textit{true} distribution of their data given relatively few observations.}

%****************************************************************************
% Below are some general suggestions for writing your dissertation:
%
% 1. Label everything with a meaningful prefix so that you
%    can refer back to sections, tables, figures, equations, etc.
%    Usage \label{<prefix>:<label_name>} where some suggested
%    prefixes are:
%			ch: Chapter
%     		se: Section
%     		ss: Subsection
%     		sss: Sub-subsection
%			app: Appendix
%     		ase: Appendix section
%     		tab: Tables
%     		fig: Figures
%     		sfig: Sub-figures
%     		eq: Equations
%
% 2. The VTthesis class provides for natbib citations. You should upload
%	 one or more *.bib bibtex files. Suppose you have two bib files: some_refs.bib and 
%    other_refs.bib.  Then your bibliography line to include them
%    will be:
%      \bibliography{some_refs, other_refs}
%    where multiple files are separated by commas. In the body of 
%    your work, you can cite your references using natbib citations.
%    Examples:
%      Citation                     Output
