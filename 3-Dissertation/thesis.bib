@Comment This is an old article, the authors argue it is best to use
@Comment the fewest possible parameters to model the expected
@Comment performance of a systme. They subjectively decided those
@Comment parameters (two for system, a few more for applications) to
@Comment predict performance based on memory / network bottlenecks.
