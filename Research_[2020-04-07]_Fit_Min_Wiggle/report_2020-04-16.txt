Methods of Estimating Derivatives (cont.)
In the context of quintic spline interpolation
:: Thomas Lux :: tchlux@vt.edu :: https://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux

The setup for this report is the same as for @{the previous report}{https://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/files/%5B2020-04-13%5D_report_on_pqmsi/report.html}@. However, in this report the following two methods are considered.

| **METHOD** | | | **Description** |
| **facet**     | *3 pt.*<br>*facet*<br>*model* | $\quad$ | Constructs local linear regression models over $\{x_{j-2},$ $x_{j-1},$ $x_j\},$ $\{x_{j-1},$ $x_j,$ $x_{j+1}\},$ and $\{x_{j},$ $x_{j+1},$ $x_{j+2}\}.$ The assigned slope at $x_j$ is that of the regression model with the lowest sum of squared error (over its domain) of the three regression models. When the first derivative is given at $x_j$ it is directly assigned. The second derivative is always assigned to zero. |
| **quadratic** | *Quadratic*<br>*interpolant*  |         | Interpolates at $x_{j-1},$ $x_j,$ and $x_{j+1}.$ When a first derivative is given at $x_j$, that constraint is included in the interpolant and the function value at the nearer of $x_{j-1}$ or $x_{j+1}$ is interpolated. |

What follows are examples of the resulting piecewise monotone quintic spline interpolants constructed after each method provides initial derivative estimates. The spline will be a solid blue line, the provided points are styled according to constraints (see legend below), and the shape of the local fit for each point is a dotted line interpolating that point (if you can't see it, it's because it overlaps the blue line). The first test problem considered is as follows.

For context, here is the PCHIP (Piecewise **Cubic** Hermite Interpolating Polynomial) interpolant produced over these points and values.

# Extended Test Problems

In addition to that one problem, the following examples may also be of interest. The resulting piecewise monotone quintic spline interpolant from {3c5096}the facet model{3c5096} is a blue solid line, from {64b414}the local quadratic interpolant{64b414} is the dotted green line.

Test 0 above is similar to the point set from before, but with one more point in the upper linear segment.

# Discussion of Results

The facet model is producing much more favorable results in general. There are a few instances where the local quadratic estimate to the second derivative is better. It seems like the facet model is the best going forward, especially if a better estimate of second derivative can be calculated.

On possible methods for estimating the second derivatives:

1) A local quintic interpolant could interpolate the first derivative at $x_{j-1},$ $x_j,$ and $x_{j+1}.$ The second derivative of this interpolant could be used.
2) The local quadratic interpolant over $x_{j-1},$ $x_j,$ $x_{j+1}$ could also be used to estimated the second derivative.
