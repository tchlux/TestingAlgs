v0
  All quadratics are recomputed at each step.
  B-splines are evaluated with the simple logic (redundant differences).
  Search shrinks step size, then re-increases step size at half the rate.
  Is monotone check still uses the linear version, needs to be reduced.

v1
  Simplified the computation for monotonicity checks.
  Added test for random monotone data, instead of purely random data.

v2
  Pre-computed "U1 - U0" as "WIDTH" to remove redundant computations.
  Removed redundancy from quadratic computations, reuse old computed coefficients.
