- remove error checking code from "eval B-spline"
- reuse the computed quadratics when initializing
- use Mathematica to simplify the check for monotonicity (fewest terms)
- pre-compute differences between breakpoints for faster evaluation

- write a separate fit routine that fits Bernstein polynomial coefficients
- write a separate evaluation routine that evaluates Bernstein polynomial bases
