    PMQSI: Piecewise monotone quintic spline interpolation

The package  PMQSI  is a collection of Fortran 95 routines for the
construction of piecewise monotone quintic spline interpolants. All
contained routines use the module  REAL_PRECISION  from HOMPACK90 (ACM
TOMS Algorithm 777) for specifying the real data type.

The physical organization into files is as follows.

 * The file 'REAL_PRECISION.f90' contains the module  REAL_PRECISION.
 * The file 'PMQSI.f90' contains the subroutine  PMQSI, which computes
   a piecewise monotone quintic spline interpolant of data in terms
   of a B-spline basis.
 * The file 'SPLINE.f90' contains the subroutines  FIT_SPLINE  for
   constructing a B-spline basis representation of a spline that
   interpolates given function and derivative values at data, and
   EVAL_SPLINE  for computing the value, derivatives, and integral of
   a spline in terms of its B-spline basis.
 * The file 'EVAL_BSPLINE.f90' contains the subroutine  EVAL_BSPLINE
   a Fortran 95 implementation of the B-spline recurrence relation
   evaluation code first introduced by C. de Boor, which computes the
   B-spline defined by a knot sequence, derivatives of that B-spline,
   and the integral of that B-spline.
 * The files 'blas.f' and 'lapack.f' contain just the necessary BLAS and
   LAPACK routines, in case the complete BLAS and LAPACK libraries are not
   available.

To compile and link, use the command:

 $F95 $OPTS REAL_PRECISION.f90 EVAL_BSPLINE.f90 SPLINE.f90 PMQSI.f90 \
    $MAIN -o $EXEC_NAME $LIB

where '$F95' is the name of the Fortran 95 compiler, '$OPTS' are
compiler options such as '-c' and '-O3', '$MAIN' is the name of the
main program, '$EXEC_NAME' is the name of the executable, and '$LIB'
provides a flag to link BLAS and LAPACK. If the BLAS and LAPACK
libraries are not available on your system, then replace $LIB with the
filenames 'blas.f lapack.f'; these provided files contain just the
necessary routines from the BLAS and LAPACK libraries.

This package includes a test suite in the file 'test.f90' which can be
compiled and linked with the command:

 $F95 $OPTS REAL_PRECISION.f90 EVAL_BSPLINE.f90 SPLINE.f90 PMQSI.f90 \
    test.f90 -o test $LIB

then run with the command:

 ./test
