# Approximating a Differential Model from Data

  **Goal:** Identify best approximation techniques for constructing models of a truth function $\ f: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{b}$ of the forms:

   $\ \hat f: \mathbb{R}^{d+\nabla d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{b}$
     Position + change $\rightarrow$ new response value.

   $\ \hat f: \mathbb{R}^{d+b} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\nabla d}$
     Position + new response $\rightarrow$ necessary change.

  where $\mathbb{R}^{d+\nabla d}$ denotes the real vector space $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ in which the fist half of the vector is the current position and the second half of the vector is the "change" in position. The approximation techniques will be constructed given a row-vector matrix of $n$ nodes $X^{(n\ \times\ d)}$ and response values $Y^{(n\ \times\ b)}$ associated with each node.

  **Target:** either TOMS or Mathematics journal depending on which is more feasible (provable properties or quality math software).

  **Steps:**
- Analyze basic theoretical properties of a model with this form given minimal assumptions (real vector space, Lipschitz continuous truth function, well spaced nodes)
- Pick data (VarSys) to do initial empirical study and convert data into differential form (distance between all pairs)
- Construct models with different approximation techniques (Delaunay, Voronoi, Box, NN) and analyze results
- Use empirical results to write a (few) paper(s)
- Develop deeper theory on performance of models and what model characteristics lead to what outcomes.
- If theoretical results are interesting enough, begin targeting math journal publication, otherwise target math software implementation.

# Provable Properties of Box/Voronoi Meshes for Functional Approximation

  **Goal:** Extend my existing mesh-based approximation techniques to functional interpolation and study meaningful provable properties about them.

  **Target:** a Mathematics journal publication.

  **Steps:**
- Establish new method for approximating functions with a function as response value other than forcing weights to be convex (or perhaps not, if it turns out that my current approach is acceptable?)
- Study theoretical properties of the various approximations, what can be maintained and what can't?

# Box/Voronoi Meshes for Functional Approximation Math Software

  **Goal:** Extend my existing mesh-based approximation techniques to functional interpolation and generating an optimized and robust code-base for computing them.

  **Target:** TOMS publication.

  **Steps:**
- Establish new method for approximating functions with a function as response value other than forcing weights to be convex (or perhaps not, if it turns out that my current approach is acceptable?)
- Identify most likely use-case scenario for the routines, develop robust optimized and stable implementation of algorithms (studying potential optimizations in the process)

# Mixed Integer Programming for $L_0$

  **Goal:** Use mixed integer programming and real math-software to perform the same optimization tasks as being done in the Machine Learning (ML) community for reducing model size.

  **Target:** a series of publications (conferences, journal) in the ML community.

  **Steps:**
- Read on recently literature surrounding $L_0$, standard use case, assumptions about the problem at hand
- Read up on mixed integer programming, identify connection to current work
- Identify optimal approach to solving the standard $L_0$ problem being faced by the current ML community
- Identify and apply existing math software to the $L_0$ problem
