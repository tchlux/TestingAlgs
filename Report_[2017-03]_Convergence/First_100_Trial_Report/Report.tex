\subsection*{\hfil Comparing Throughput CDF's of 3 System Configurations \hfil}
\begin{center}

\subsection*{Summary}

In this report, we compare the Cumulative Distribution Functions
(CDF's) of the Throughput of three different system
configurations. All three configurations have the same settings for:
\begin{align*}
  Frequency  &-  2700000\\
  Hyp\ Sched &-  CFQ\\
  VM\ Sched  &-  NOOP\\
  Threads    &-  64\\
  Mode       &-  Fread
\end{align*}

While the file and record sizes for the three system settings were:
\begin{align}
  File\ Size - 64  \ \  &\ \ Record\ Size - 32\\
  File\ Size - 1024\ \  &\ \ Record\ Size - 32\\
  File\ Size - 1024\ \  &\ \ Record\ Size - 512
\end{align}

Most notably, from this in-depth comparison, it appears that our
independently drawn samples from the systems are not always conforming
to the same underlying distribution. If this trend continues, then it
will prohibit the effective modelling goals of the VarSys project.

\subsection*{Source Data}

For each of these system configurations we have 3 independently
gathered sets of data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textit{First} \textbf{40} runs collected for the VarSys data mid-last
  year.
\item The \textit{Second} set of \textbf{40} runs collected December of last year.
\item The newest, \textit{True} set of \textbf{420} runs collected two weeks ago.
\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\subsection*{Figures and Plots}

For each of the three system configurations, there is 1 figure
followed by 3 plots:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textbf{Paired KS Solved for Alpha Graph} shows the trials
  \textit{first}, \textit{second}, and \textit{true} as nodes with the
  edges between them being the result of solving the KS Two Sample
  test for alpha (see explanation in item 4 below). This will be
  followed by the 'Confidence' interpretation below.

\item The \textbf{CDF Comparison Plot} shows the Throughput CDF's of
  each of the \textit{first}, \textit{second}, and \textit{true} data
  sets. Each CDF plot also has a red-tinted cloud~\footnote{The clouds
    were generated by taking 10,000 random 40 sample subsets of the
    (\textit{true}) 420, calculating the CDF's of each subset, then
    calculating the percentiles of possible \textit{true} CDF values
    based on the sapmle CDF's.} of the possible positions that the
  \textit{true} CDF could take on when collecting 40 sample subsets.

\item The \textbf{Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Difference Plot} shows the
  decrease in KS difference~\footnote{The two-sample KS Difference is
    simply the maximum difference between the two CDF's of the
    samples. From this difference, a test is performed to determine if
    the two distributions are different.}  between a subsapmle and the
  \textit{true} CDF with increasing subsample size (x-axis).

\item The \textbf{Confidence in KS Difference Plot} shows what happens
  when we take the typical KS test for difference:
  \begin{align*}
    \text{KS Diff} &> c(\alpha) \sqrt{\frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1 \cdot n_2}}\\
    \text{where}\ c(\alpha) &= \sqrt{-\frac{1}{2}ln\bigg(\frac{\alpha}{2}\bigg)}
  \end{align*}
  and use our knowledge of $n_1$, $n_2$ and the KS Difference to solve
  for the minimum alpha such that this inequality holds. Giving us:
  \begin{align*}
    \alpha\ \  >\ \  2 \cdot e^{-2 \cdot \bigg(\frac{\text{KS Diff}}{\sqrt{\frac{n_1 + n_2}{n_1 \cdot n_2}}}\bigg)^2}
  \end{align*}
  This final plot shows $100 \cdot (1 - \alpha)$, or the approximate
  confidence, in percentage, that the two distributions being compared
  are different. This data was collected by comparing the CDF's of 100
  random subsamples of size $\textless$x-axis$\textgreater$ to the
  \textit{true} CDF. The corresponding y-values are displayed in shaded
  regions by percentile.Ideally we want this quantity to go to zero.

\end{enumerate}
