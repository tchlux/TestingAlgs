<p>Each of high performance computing, cloud computing, and computer security have their own interests in modeling and predicting the performance of computers with respect to how they are configured. An effective model might infer internal mechanics, minimize power consumption, or maximize computational throughput of a given system. This paper analyzes a four-dimensional dataset measuring the input/output (I/O) characteristics of a cluster of identical computers using the benchmark IOzone. The I/O performance characteristics are modeled with respect to system configuration using multivariate interpolation and approximation techniques. The analysis reveals that accurate models of I/O characteristics for a computer system may be created from a small fraction of possible configurations, and that some modeling techniques will continue to perform well as the number of system parameters being modeled increases. These results have strong implications for future predictive analyses based on more comprehensive sets of system parameters.</p>
<span class='header' id='The Importance and Applications of Variability'></span><h2> The Importance and Applications of Variability</h2>

<p>Performance tuning is often an experimentally complex and time intensive chore necessary for configuring HPC systems. The procedures for this tuning vary largely from system to system and are often subjectively guided by the system engineer(s). Once a desired level of performance is achieved, an HPC system may only be incrementally reconfigured as required by updates or specific jobs. In the case that a system has changing workloads or nonstationary performance objectives that range from maximizing computational throughput to minimizing power consumption and system variability, it becomes clear that a more effective and automated tool is needed for configuring systems. This scenario presents a challenging and important application of multivariate approximation and interpolation techniques.</p>

<p>Predicting the performance of an HPC system is a challenging problem that is primarily attempted in one of two ways: (1) build a statistical model of the performance by running experiments on the system at select settings, or (2) run artificial experiments using a simplified simulation of the target system to estimate architecture and application bottlenecks. In this section the proposed multivariate modeling techniques rest in the first category, and they represent a notable increase in the ability to model complex interactions between system parameters.</p>

<p>Many previous works attempting to model system performance have used simulated environments to estimate the performance of a system <dt-cite key="grobelny2007fase,wang2009simulation,wang2013towards"></dt-cite>. Some of these works refer to statistical models as being oversimplified and not capable of capturing the true complexity of the underlying system. This claim is partially correct, noting that a large portion of predictive statistical models rely on simplifying the model to one or two parameters <dt-cite key="snavely2002framework,bailey2005performance,barker2009using,ye2010analyzing"></dt-cite>. These limited statistical models have provided satisfactory performance in very narrow application settings. Many of the aforementioned statistical modeling techniques claim to generalize, while simultaneously requiring additional code annotations, hardware abstractions, or additional application level understandings in order to generate models. The approach presented here requires no modifications of the application, no architectural abstractions, nor any structural descriptions of the input data being modeled. The techniques used are purely mathematical and only need performance data
as input.</p>

<p>Among the statistical models presented in prior works, <dt-cite key="bailey2005performance"></dt-cite> specifically mention that it is difficult for the simplified models to capture variability introduced by I/O. System variability in general has become a problem of increasing interest to the HPC and systems communities, however most of the work has focused on operating system (OS) induced variability <dt-cite key="beckman2008benchmarking,de2007identifying"></dt-cite>. The work that has focused on managing I/O variability does not use any sophisticated modeling techniques <dt-cite key="lofstead2010managing"></dt-cite>. Hence, this section presents a case study applying advanced mathematical and statistical modeling techniques to the domain of HPC I/O characteristics. The models are used to predict the mean throughput of a system and the variance in throughput of a system. The discussion section outlines how the techniques presented can be applied to any performance metric and any system.</p>
<span class='header' id='Naive Approximations of Variability'></span><h2> Naive Approximations of Variability</h2>

<p>In general, this section compares five multivariate approximation techniques that operate on inputs in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (\(d\)-tuples of real numbers) and produce predicted responses in \(\mathbb{R}\). In order to provide coverage of the varied mathematical strategies that can be employed to solve the continuous modeling problem, three of the techniques are regression based and the remaining two are interpolants. The sections below outline the mathematical formulation of each technique and provide computational complexity bounds with respect to the size (number of points and dimension) of input data. Throughout, \(d\) will refer to the dimension of the input data, \(n\) is the number of points in the input data, \(x^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the \(i\)-th input data point, \(x^{(i)}_j\) is the \(j\)-th component of \(x^{(i)}\), and \(f(x^{(i)})\) is the response value of the \(i\)-th input data point.</p>

<p>In order to evaluate the viability of multivariate models for predicting system performance, this section presents a case study of a four-dimensional dataset produced by executing the IOzone benchmark from <dt-cite key="iozone"></dt-cite> on a homogeneous cluster of computers. All experiments were performed on parallel shared-memory nodes common to HPC systems. Each system had a lone guest Linux operating system (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS//XEN 4.0) on a dedicated 2TB HDD on a 2 socket, 4 core (2 hyperthreads per core) Intel Xeon E5-2623 v3 (Haswell) platform with 32 GB DDR4. The system performance data was collected by executing IOzone 40 times for each of a select set of system configurations. A single IOzone execution reports the max I/O throughput seen for the selected test in kilobytes per second. The 40 executions for each system configuration are converted into the mean and variance, both values in \(\mathbb{R}\) capable of being modeled individually by the multivariate approximation techniques presented in Section Multivariate. The summary of data used in the experiments for this section can be seen in the <a class="jump" href="#System Configurations">System Configurations</a> Table. Distributions of raw throughput values being modeled can be seen in the <a class="jump" href="#Raw Throughput">Raw Throughput</a> Figure.</p>

</p><span class='header' id='Dimensional Analysis'></span><h3> Dimensional Analysis</h3>

<p>This work utilizes an extension to standard \(k\)-fold cross validation
that allows for a more thorough investigation of the expected model
performance in a variety of real-world situations. Alongside
randomized splits, two extra components are considered: the amount of
training data provided, and the dimension of the input data. It is
important to consider that algorithms that perform well with less
training input also require less experimentation. Although, the amount
of training data required may change as a function of the dimension of
the input and this needs to be studied as well. The framework used
here will be referred to as a multidimensional analysis (MDA) of the
IOzone data.</p>
<span class='header' id='Multidimensional Analysis'></span><h4> Multidimensional Analysis</h4>

<p>This procedure combines random selection of training and testing
splits with changes in the input dimension and the ratio of training
size to testing size. Given an input data matrix with \(n\) rows
(points) and \(d\) columns (components), MDA proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>
<ol><li> For all \(k = 1\), \(\ldots\), \(d\) and for all nonempty subsets \(F \subset \{1, 2, \ldots, d\}\), reduce the input data to points \((z, f_F(z))\) with \(z \in \mathbb{R}^k\) and \(f_F(z) = E\bigl[ \bigl\{ f\bigl(x^{(i)}\bigr) \bigm| \bigl(x^{(i)}_F = z\bigr) \bigr\} \bigr]\), where \(E[\cdot]\) denotes the mean and \(x^{(i)}_F\) is the subvector of \(x^{(i)}\) indexed by \(F\).</li>
<li> For all \(r\) in \(\{5, 10, \ldots, 95\}\), generate \(N\) random splits \((train, test)\) of the reduced data with \(r\) percentage for training and \(100 - r\) percentage for testing.</li>
<li> When generating each of \(N\) random \((train, test)\) splits, ensure that all points from \(test\) are in the convex hull of points in \(train\) (to prevent extrapolation); also ensure that the points in \(train\) are well spaced.</li></ol></p>

<p>In order to ensure that the testing points are in the convex hull of
the training points, the convex hull vertices of each set of (reduced
dimension) points are forcibly placed in the training set. In order to
ensure that training points are well spaced, a statistical method for
picking points from <dt-cite key="amos2014algorithm"></dt-cite> is used:</p>

<p>
<ol><li> Generate a sequence of all pairs of points \(\bigl(z^{(i_1)},z^{(j_1)}\bigr), \bigl(z^{(i_2)},z^{(j_2)}\bigr), \ldots\) sorted by ascending pairwise Euclidean distance between points, so that \(\bigl|\bigl|z^{(i_k)}-z^{(j_k)}\bigr|\bigr|_2 \leq \bigl|\bigl|z^{(i_{k+1})}-z^{(j_{k+1})}\bigr|\bigr|_2\).</li>
<li> Sequentially remove points from candidacy until only \(|train|\) remain by randomly selecting one point from the pair \(\bigl(z^{(i_m)}, z^{(j_m)}\bigr)\) for \(m = 1,\ldots\) if both \(z^{(i_m)}\) and \(z^{(j_m)}\) are still candidates for removal.</li></ol></p>

<p>Given the large number of constraints, level of reduction, and use of
randomness in the MDA procedure, occasionally \(N\) unique
training/testing splits may not be created or may not exist. In these
cases, if there are fewer than \(N\) possible splits, then
deterministically generated splits are used. Otherwise after \(3N\)
attempts, only the unique splits are kept for analysis. The MDA
procedure has been implemented in Python#3 while most regression and
interpolation methods are Fortran wrapped with Python. All randomness
has been seeded for repeatability.</p>

<p>For any index subset \(F\) (of size \(k\)) and selected value of \(r\), MDA
will generate up to \(N\) multivariate models \(f_F(z)\) and predictions
\(\hat{f}_F\big(z^{(i)}\big)\) for a point \(z^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^k\).
There may be fewer than \(N\) predictions made for any given
point. Extreme points of the convex hull for the selected index subset
will always be used for training, never for testing. Points that do
not have any close neighbors will often be used for training in order
to ensure well-spacing. Finally, as mentioned before, some index
subsets do not readily generate \(N\) unique training and testing
splits. The summary results presented in this work use the median of
the (\(N\) or fewer) values \(\hat{f}_F(z)\) at each point as the model
estimate for error analysis.</p>
<span class='header' id='Results'></span><h3> Results</h3>

<p>A naive multivariate prediction technique such as nearest
neighbor could experience relative errors in the range \(\displaystyle
[0, \big(\max_x f(x) - \min_x f(x)\big) / \min_x f(x) ]\) when modeling
a nonnegative function \(f(x)\) from data. The IOzone mean data response
values span three orders of magnitude (as can be seen in the
<a class="jump" href="#System Configurations">System Configurations</a> Table) while variance data response values span six
orders of magnitude. It is expected therefore, that all studied
multivariate models perform better than a naive approach,
achieving relative errors strictly less than \(10^3\) for throughput
mean and \(10^6\) for throughput variance. Ideally, models will yield
relative errors significantly smaller than 1. The time required to
compute thousands of models involved in processing the IOzone data
through MDA was approximately five hours on a CentOS workstation with
an Intel i7-3770 CPU at 3.40GHz. In four dimensions for example, each
of the models could be constructed and evaluated over hundreds of
points in less than a few seconds.</p>
<span class='header' id='I/O Throughput Mean'></span><h4> I/O Throughput Mean</h4>

<p>Almost all multivariate models analyzed make predictions with a
relative error less than 1 for most system configurations when
predicting the mean I/O throughput of a system given varying amounts
of training data. The overall best of the multivariate models,
Delaunay, consistently makes predictions with relative error less than
\(.05\) (5% error). In Figure Mean tt Ratio it can also be
seen that the Delaunay model consistently makes good predictions even
with as low as 5% training data (43 of the 864 system configurations)
regardless of the dimension of the data.</p>

<span class='header' id='I/O Throughput Variance'></span><h4> I/O Throughput Variance</h4>

<p>predicting mean. Delaunay remains the best overall predictor
(aggregated across training percentages and dimensions) with median
relative error of .47 and LSHEP closely competes with Delaunay having
a median signed relative error of -.92. Outliers in prediction error
are much larger for all models. Delaunay produces relative errors as
large as 78 and other models achieve relative errors around
\(10^3\). The relative errors for many models scaled proportional to the
increased orders of magnitude spanned by the variance response
compared with mean response. As can be seen in Figure <a class="jump" href="#Variance Train/Test Ratio">Variance Train/Test Ratio</a>, all models are more sensitive to the amount of
training data provided than their counterparts for predicting mean.</p>
<span class='header' id='Increasing Dimension and Decreasing Training Data'></span><h4> Increasing Dimension and Decreasing Training Data</h4>

<p>As can be seen in the <a class="jump" href="#Mean Dim">Mean Dim</a> Figure, all of the models suffer
increasing error rates in higher dimension. This is expected, because
the number of possible interactions to model grows
exponentially. However, LSHEP and Delaunay maintain the slowest
increase in relative error. The increase in error seen for Delaunay
suggests that it is capable of making predictions with a range of
relative errors that grows approximately linearly with increasing
dimension input. This trend suggests that Delaunay would remain a
viable technique for accurately modeling systems with 10's of
parameters given only small amounts of training data. All models, with
the exception of MARS, produce smaller errors given more training
data. Increasing the amount of training data most notably reduces the
number of prediction error outliers.</p>
<span class='header' id='Discussion of Results'></span><h3> Discussion of Results</h3>

<p>The present results demonstrate that a straightforward application of
multivariate modeling techniques can be used to effectively predict
HPC system performance. Some modeling effort on the part of a systems
engineer combined with a significant amount of experimentation (days
of CPU time for the IOzone data used here) can yield a model capable
of accurately tuning an HPC system to the desired performance
specification, although qualitatively correct predictions can be
achieved with much less (10%, say) effort.</p>
<span class='header' id='Modeling the System'></span><h4> Modeling the System</h4>

<p>The modeling techniques generated estimates of drastically different
quality when predicting I/O throughput mean and variance. A few
observations: SVR has the largest range of errors for all selections
of dimension and amounts of training data; MARS and LSHEP produce
similar magnitude errors while the former consistently underestimates
and the latter consistently overestimates; Delaunay has considerably
fewer outliers than all other methods. SVR likely produces the poorest
quality predictions because the underlying parametric representation
is global and oversimplified (a single polynomial), making it unable
to capture the complex local behaviors of system I/O. It is still
unclear, however, what causes the behaviors of LSHEP, MARS, and
Delaunay. An exploration of this topic is left to future work.</p>

<p>While the Delaunay method appears to be the best predictor in the
present IOzone case study, it is important to note that the Delaunay
computational complexity increases with the dimension of the input
more rapidly than other techniques. The implementation of Delaunay
(QuickHull) used would experience unacceptably large training times
beyond ten-dimensional input. This leaves much room for other
techniques to perform best in higher dimension unless a more efficient
implementation of Delaunay can be used.</p>

<p>Finally, the ability of the models to predict variance was
significantly worse than for the I/O mean. The larger scale in
variance responses alone do not account for the increase in relative
errors witnessed. This suggests that system variability has a greater
underlying functional complexity than the system mean and that latent
factors are reducing prediction performance.</p>
<span class='header' id='Extending the Analysis'></span><h4> Extending the Analysis</h4>

<p>System I/O throughput mean and variance are simple and useful system
characteristics to model. The process presented in this work is
equally applicable to predicting other useful performance
characteristics of HPC systems such as: computational throughput,
power consumption, processor idle time, context switches, RAM usage,
or any other ordinal performance metric. For each of these there is
the potential to model system variability as well. This work has
chosen variance as a measure of variability, but the techniques used
in this paper could be applied to more precise measures of variability
such as the percentiles of the performance distribution or the entire
distribution itself. A thorough exploration of HPC systems
applications of multivariate modeling constitutes future work.</p>
<span class='header' id='Conclusion of This Section'></span><h3> Conclusion of This Section</h3>

<p>Multivariate models of HPC system performance can effectively predict
I/O throughput mean and variance. These multivariate techniques
significantly expand the scope and portability of statistical models
for predicting computer system performance over previous work. In the
IOzone case study presented, the Delaunay method produces the best
overall results making predictions for 821 system configurations with
less than 5% error when trained on only 43 configurations. Analysis
also suggests that the error in the Delaunay method will remain
acceptable as the number of system parameters being modeled
increases. These multivariate techniques can and should be applied to
HPC systems with more than four tunable parameters in order to
identify optimal system configurations that may not be discoverable
via previous methods nor by manual performance tuning.</p>

<p>This portion of the document proposes research on the numerically robust construction of monotone quintic interpolating splines from data that are \(C^2\).</p>
<span class='header' id='Introduction and Motivation'></span><h3> Introduction and Motivation</h3>

<p>Many domains of science rely on smooth approximations to real-valued functions over a closed interval. These smooth approximations are regularly used in automotive and aerospace engineering, architecture, mathematics and especially statistics <dt-cite key="knott2012interpolating"></dt-cite>. While polynomial interpolants or regressors apply broadly, piecewise polynomial functions (splines) are often a good choice because they can approximate globally complex functions while minimizing local complexity of the approximation. It is often the case that the true underlying function or phenomenon being modeled has known properties e.g., convexity, positivity, various levels of continuity, or monotonicity. Given a reasonably large amount of data, it can be impossible to maintain these properties with a single polynomial function.</p>

<p>In general, the maintenance of function properties through interpolation / regression is usually referred to as <i>shape preserving</i> <dt-cite key="fritsch1980monotone,gregory1985shape"></dt-cite>. The specific shapes this work will focus on are monotonicity and multiple levels of continuity for a function. These properties are chiefly important to the approximation of cumulative distribution functions and subsequently the effective generation of random numbers from a specified distribution. </p>

<p>In statistics especially, the construction of a monotone interpolating spline that is continuous in second derivative is meaningfully useful <dt-cite key="ramsay1988monotone"></dt-cite>. A function with these properties could approximate random variables to a high level of accuracy with relatively few intervals<dt-fn>with even more accuracy given greater continuity</dt-fn>. A continuously twice differentiable approximation to a cumulative distribution function would also produce a corresponding probability density function that is continuously differentiable, which is a property many commonly occurring parametric distributions maintain.</p>

<p>The current state-of-the-art monotone interpolating spline with a mathematical software implementation is piecewise cubic, continuously differentiable, and was first proposed in <dt-cite key="fritsch1980monotone"></dt-cite> then expanded upon in <dt-cite key="carlson1985monotone"></dt-cite>. Let \(\pi: a = x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n = b\) be a partition of the interval \([a,b]\). Let \(\{f(x_i) : i = 1,2,\ldots,n\}\) be a given set of data values at the partition points for a monotone function \(f\), meaning \(f(x_i) \leq f(x_{i+1})\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, n-1\) or \(f(x_i) \geq f(x_{i+1})\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, n-1\). Let \(\hat f\) be a piecewise cubic spline defined in each sub-interval \(I_i = [x_i, x_{i+1}]\) by</p>

<p>
$$ \begin{align}

h_i =& \ x_{i+1} - x_{i} \\
u(t) =& \ 3t^2 - 2t^3 \\
p(t) =& \ t^3 - t^2 \\
\hat f(x) =& \ f(x_i)\ u\big((x_{i+1} - x) / h_i\big) + f(x_{i+1})\ u\big((x - x_i) / h_i\big) \\
& - \hat f^{\ \prime}(x_i)\ p\big((x_{i+1}-x)/h_i\big) + \hat f^{\ \prime}(x_{i+1})\ p\big((x-x_i)/h_i \big).

\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Notice that it is up to the user to choose values for \(\hat f^{\ \prime}\)and a viable monotonic cubic spline can be produced by choosing \(\hat f^{\ \prime}(x_i) = 0\), \(i = 1, \ldots, n\). However, such a spline has too many <i>wiggles</i> for most applications. Fritsch and Carlson proceed to show that simple conditions on the derivative values can guarantee monotonicity, and that these conditions can be enforced in a way that ensures modifications on one interval will not break the monotonicity of cubic polynomials over any neighboring intervals. Consider the terms \(\alpha = \frac{\hat f^{\ \prime}(x_i) (x_{i+1}-x_i)}{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)}\) and \(\beta = \frac{\hat f^{\ \prime}(x_{i+1}) (x_{i+1}-x_i)}{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)}\), now monotonicity of a cubic polynomial over a sub-interval can be maintained by ensuring that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) reside in any of the following regions.</p>

<p><iframe src='http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/files/Dissertation/feasible_region.html' frameBorder='0' style='height: 420px; width: 510px;'></iframe></p>

<p>The actual region of monotonicity for a cubic polynomial is larger, but projection of \((\alpha, \beta)\) into one of these regions ensures that monotonicity will be achieved and not violated for neighboring regions. The user must decide which region is most suitable to project \((\alpha, \beta)\) onto, Fritsch and Carlson recommend using region 2.</p>

<p>This theoretical work has been extended in <dt-cite key="ulrich1994positivity,hess1994positive"></dt-cite> to monotone quintic polynomials, but no mathematical software has been produced accordingly. That is where this proposed work comes in.</p>
<span class='header' id='Achieved Progress'></span><h3> Achieved Progress</h3>

<p>To expand my own understanding of the current state-of-the-art method for constructing a monotone spline interpolant, I <font color='#37a'> <a href='https://github.com/tchlux/VarSys/blob/master/Disseration/cubic.py'>fully implemented</a> </font> the algorithm described in <dt-cite key="fritsch1980monotone"></dt-cite> in Python. This code can be used to generate monotone cubic spline fits to data and allows for the user specification of a method<dt-fn>the means by which monotonicity is enforced</dt-fn> and derivatives at any of the knots or endpoints. Clearly this code is not optimized for numerical robustness, nor speed, but it serves as a portable demonstration and educational tool.</p>

<p>Here we can see the recommended method of projection for moving cubic polynomials into the region of monotonicity.</p>

<p><iframe src='http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/files/Dissertation/demo_projection.html' frameBorder='0' style='height: 420px; width: 510px;'></iframe></p>

<p>The resulting interpolating spline is \(C^1\) and has a <i>smooth</i> appearance, here is a demonstration when using Region 2.</p>

<p><iframe src='http://people.cs.vt.edu/tchlux/files/Dissertation/demo_fit.html' frameBorder='0' style='height: 420px; width: 510px;'></iframe></p>

<p>And the derivative of the above spline is continuous.</p>

<span class='header' id='Final Remarks'></span><h3> Final Remarks</h3>

<p>This project has the potential to be very widely utilized. As described earlier, many statistical applications could greatly benefit from having a \(C^2\) approximation to CDFs, because the resulting PDF will be both aesthetically pleasing and more accurate for continuous distributions.</p>

<p>I spent last summer preparing a <a href='https://github.com/tchlux/VarSys/blob/master/Code_[2018-06-11]_Stable_Arbitrary_Box_Splines/boxspline.f90'>mathematical software</a> for the evaluation of box-splines, which may (or may not) be included in this package as well.</p>
