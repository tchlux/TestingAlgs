Approximation Error Bounds

## Definitions

  We first adopt the *multi-index* notation for multivariate polynomials from *Cheney and Light* [[cheney2009course]].

  When considering functions of $d$ real variables, the variables denoted $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_d$ can be put into a vector called $x = (\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_d),$ $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$.

  Let $\mathbb{Z}$ denote the set of all integers and $\mathbb{Z}_+$ non-negative integers. The notation $\mathbb{Z}^d_+$ then means the set of all $d$-tuples $\alpha = (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_d),$ where $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

  For a *multi-index* we write $|\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \ldots + \alpha_d$. Then for $x = (\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_d)$ and $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_d)$, it follows that
  $$x^\alpha := \prod_{i=1}^d \xi^{\alpha_i}_i = \xi^{\alpha_1}_1 \cdots \xi^{\alpha_d}_d$$

  Now a polynomial in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be written as
  $$p(x) = \sum_\alpha c_\alpha x^\alpha$$
  in which the sum is finite, the $c_\alpha$ are real numbers, and $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^d_+$. The degree of $p$ is
  $$ \max \{ |\alpha| : c_\alpha \not = 0 \}, $$
  and when all $c_\alpha$ are $0,$ then $p(x) = 0,$ and we assign the degree $-\infty$ to the polynomial.

  Finally, let $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a multivariate polynomial function, and let $X = \{x_1, \ldots x_n : x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\}$ and $Y = \{f(x_i) : x_i \in X\}$. We will now consider the maximum error in various approximations $\hat f$ of the underlying polynomial function.



# Delaunay Simplicial Mesh

  Let $\{x_1, \ldots, x_d+1\}$ be the set vertices of a simplex $s$ in a Delaunay simplicial mesh, where $s$ has *circumsphere radius* $r$ and center $c_s \in \mathbb{R}^d$.

- If $f$ has degree $k$, then the maximum possible error of $\hat f$ over $s$ occurs at $c_s$ and has value $\cdots$


%% ## Theorem
%%   Suppose the degree of $f$ is $k$, then the maximum error over a Delaunay simplex occurs at the middle of the simplex and is bounded by $\cdots$

%% ## Theorem
%%   $f$ must be convex if the maximum error over a simplex is bounded by some constant $c \in \mathbb{R}_+$.
%%     *only true when $c = 0$*

%% ### Writing Proofs
%% - Make a list of decreasingly useful statements about something
%% - Disprove by counterexample starting a the top of the list
%% - When you cannot disprove by counterexample, attempt to prove the statement
