This version removes the precomputation of the box spline normal
vectors. The computation of the normal vectors is still witheld until
evaluation, so the numerical consistency gains remain. Some speed
gains are lost, but memory footprint is reduced significantly so that
the code could theoretically be applied to larger dimension data.
